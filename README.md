# Basic Python Movie Trailer Project
###### Final project for the Udacity course “Programming Foundations with Python” in support of the [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

## Quickstart:

The project requires Python 2.7 or higher, the three supporting Python files listed below in “What’s Included”, and an internet connection.

To set up the project, download the three python files and put them together on the system in the same location. **The files must be co-located in the same folder in order for the project to run.** Run the entertainment_center.py file in Python to see the resultant movie trailer website.

Three files:<br>
   - entertainment_center.py <br>
   - fresh_tomatoes.py <br>
